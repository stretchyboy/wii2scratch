If its all worked your WiiMote will rumble for half a second.

If not try running Wii2Scratch.jar on the command line by going to the install directory in a dos prompt and running 
	java -jar Wii2Scratch.jar
	
This will give you more info.

I will be writing a GUI  so you can see what is going on better soon.

To turn Wii2Scratch off press the 'Home' key on your WiiMote.


The wiki contains all the instuctions you can send to the WiiMote.
